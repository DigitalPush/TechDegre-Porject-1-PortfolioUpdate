        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Marketing has always been my passion. When my friends wanted to set up a business to mow laws for the summer, I was figuring out who our competition and how we could win over their customers.  </p>
        <p>That summer between 9th grade and 10th grade taught me much about the art of selling, branding, and marketing. Fifteen years, a college degree, several internships and working for a one of the most well known marketing agencies in D.C. has taught me even more.</p>
